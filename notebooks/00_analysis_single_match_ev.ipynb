    "# Analysis: Single Match Relative EV (Value Bet Strategy)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a value-betting strategy for MonPetitProno.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Edge\n",
    "\n",
    "The core market inefficiency is that MPP **freezes the points** for each outcome (`g1, g2, g3`) long before the match, based on old bookmaker odds. The **live bookmaker odds** (`c1, c2, c3`) give us a much more accurate \"ground truth\" probability (`gtp1, gtp2, gtp3`) of each outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our edge comes from finding bets where the **frozen points are high relative to the true probability** (`gtp * g` is high).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't just want a high EV; we want a high **Relative EV**. We want to maximize our expected points *relative to the other players in the pool*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Calculate `Relative EV = E[My_Score] - E[Average_Opponent_Score]` for each of the three possible bets (Bet Win, Bet Draw, Bet Loss) and choose the highest one."
